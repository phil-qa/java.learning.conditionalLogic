The If then is the most basic of all control flow statements. It executes on a certain piece of code if a condition
evaluates to true from an expression

This is conditional logic and operates on the two states of true and false

For the conditional statements
==
<=
>=
&&
||
we also have bitwise operations :
&
|

Note that = is not the same as == where the latter is a conditional check, there is an exception to this :
int value = 10;
if(value = 10) < that will generate an error as the operation is assigning a value not comparing it

however
boolean thing = false;
if (thing = true)
    //do something
That is legit and will actually something even though the initial assignment was different, because the type supports
an assignment to that true value

ternary operator
This is a much nicer way of handling certain situations where perhaps there are limited responses needed to a logical
check
